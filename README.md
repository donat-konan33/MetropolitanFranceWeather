In this project I will deploy Complete Data Pipeline and Visualization apps into a Kubernetes Cluster:

- `Airbyte` : for data integration
- `Apache Airflow` : for orchestration of complete Data Pipeline Workflow
- `Streamlit` : for analytics from BigQuery DataWarehouse

K8s (Kubernetes) will be used to orchestrate different apps containers.
That helps Scaling up ressources when needed.
